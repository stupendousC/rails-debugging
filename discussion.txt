1.  What process did you use to get to know the codebase?
    I poked around to get a basic idea of what routes and ctrllers/models/views are in there.  
    ! Run the tests!
    Look at the actual site the users user... 
      are they logged in or not?
      what kind of user?
    Being able to repro the bug... esp if it depends on specific data
    Read the code 
      Depth: Follow a user story or user flow.  Start with what a user sees (view) and the trace what uses that code, etc etc
      Breadth: Trying to see how a specifric conce3pt/object/variable/word/etc is being used throughout the project

2.  Did it work?
    yeah

3.  What would you do differently next time?
    probably also draw a diagram or soemthing.
    Balance beteen making as mnay small changes as necessary VS taking the time to understand the bigger picture

4.  How is debugging from a user report different from debugging in development?
    i had to first figure out how to reproduce the same error from the user report, so that took some trial and error

5.  What surprised you, about the codebase or the exercise?
    I thought I had to know the entire codebase to be able to debug, not so.
