      <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <p>Volunteers independently organize events using our online
      tools and open source curricula. In order to participate, everyone must 
      agree to our <a href="https://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>, 
      so the volunteers can work together with the students to create a safe 
      and effective learning environment for everyone.</p>
      <p>Most classes are led by working software developers who have a lot of
      knowledge and want to share their joy of coding in specific language or
      framework. Some teachers are just a little bit ahead of students. Usually
      there are many volunteers with a range of experience who can help answer
      questions and connect you to resources if you want to keep learning on your
      own.</p>
      
      <p>Bridge Foundry offers volunteer teacher training and mentors
      new organizers, including guidance on how to create a safe and effective
      learning environment. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zkxx0Ao5xeg-epedPl1zw4aZ-JKYVNc6yxx0tVSGYJo/viewform?edit_requested=true">
      lots of ways to volunteer</a>.</p>
